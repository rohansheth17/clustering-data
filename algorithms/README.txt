***********K-MEANS**************
Run first 6 blocks. In the 7th block, input the value of k. Run until 10th block where you need to input the value of k again.
Run until the 17th block, input the value of k.


***********DBSCAN************
Run first 3 blocks. Input eps and minpts in 4th block. Run until 11th block where you need to input the parameters.


***********Hierarchical***********

Run first 12 blocks. In the 13th block, you can input the number of clusters you want in place of 5 and run the block. (while(k>5):)
Run until the 22nd block where you can input the number of clusters you want in place of 10 and run the block. (while(k>10):)


***********Spectral***********

In the 2nd block, you can input the value of sigma. Run until the 16th block where you need to input k for K-means. 
Run until the 21st block where you can input the value of sigma. Run until the 26th block where you need to input k for K-means.


***********GMM***********

In the 2nd block, you can input the value of k for K-Means to find centroids as initial means. Run until the 9th block where you can 
input the parameters for GMM. Run until the 18th block where you can input the value of k for K-Means to find centroids as initial means.
Run until the 20th block where you can input the parameters for GMM.
