# clustering-data
The repository contains five clustering algorithms to find clusters of genes that exhibit similar expression profiles: K-means, Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering with Min approach, density-based, mixture model, and spectral clustering. To validate my results, I have used external indexes like Rand Index and Jaccard Coefficient. I have also visualized the ground truth clusters provided in the datasets and my clustering results by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionionality of the features to two.

To-do
. Compare these five methods and discuss their pros and cons. 
. Compare the clustering results from different clustering algorithms.
